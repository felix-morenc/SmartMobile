**General Information**
------

In the repository there are 3 different projects. For the 3 different phases of the specialization. First we had the Android Studio project from week 2 to week 5, afterwards we had IOS from week 6 to week 9 and to finish the duo projects we had PWA from week 10 to week 13. 

**Android Studio** 
For this project we used Android studio and Kotlin as our "frontend" and we used Java + Spring Boot for our API. The project was a tinder like shopping app, where users will be able to purcahse clothes, following the system of Tinder (swiping right on the ones they want and left on the ones they don't).

**IOS**
For this project we used XCode to build a game, where the users will choose from different difficulties to play. The 3 difficulties are Beginner, Semi-Pro, Challenger. The Beginner has 30mins to find the location of which he has an image displayed on the screen, to make things easier for the user there are 3 lifelines, which he can use. Additionaly there is hot/cold indicatior (which is used for each difficulty). The phone will vibrate when the game is over (ether ran out of time or reached within some radius of the destination). Semi-Pro is with less time (25mins)and without hints, meanwhile the Challenger is for 15 mins and there will be random question asked each 3 mins and based on the answer you could be punished or rewared with 1 min.

**PWA**
For the PWA project, we decided to build yet another game, which is in the studying topic. The game has for a goal to help students use distractions(phones) as a tool to practise what they learned at school (for the MVP it is only Math). The user will have to fight the boss answering mathematical question with different difficulty based on the desired attack damage. The system is using attack/defence phases to determine whether the user will receive or deliver damage. The used technologies were React.js for the frontend, with axios for the API calls and Java + Spring Boot for the backend.

**Status**
------

**Start the application**
------

All the applications have been completed for their agreed MVP.

**IOS** Needs XCode

**Android Studio**
Before Starting the application run the backend (in our case Intellij) and then run the Android Studio environemnt.

**PWA**
Before Starting the application run the backend (in our case Intellij) and then run in your prefered IDE (for us it was VS code). To run the app use the `npm install` command to install all the used libraries and then run the `npm start` command.
